# Types of Searching

**Based on reading from geeksforgeeks**

- Linear Search
    - Simple search from left to right
    - If X matches the element in an array, return the index
    - If X doesn't match, return -1
    - Time complexity is O(n)
- Binary Search
    - Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the array into half. If search value is less than middle element in array then narrow into the lower half. If search value is greater the middle element in array then narrow into the right half.
    - Space complexity is O(1). Time complexity is O(log n).
    - This can be done iterative and recursive.  
- Jump Search
- Interpolation Search
- Exponential Search
